## Extension Development Utility

>2017-04-20

This extension is a fork of "Gnome Shell Extension Reloader", an
excellent extension by Norman L. Smith you can find here :
https://github.com/nls1729/acme-code/tree/master/extension-reloader

This extension is intended for use by Gnome Shell Extension writers.
It is common practice to restart the Shell during testing to reload
an extension with changes made to the extension's code. Wayland does
not allow restarting the Shell. To reload an extension under Wayland
a logout and a login is required. "Gnome Shell Extension Reloader" 
reloads only the selected extension with two mouse clicks saving 
time for the extension writer.

"Extension Development Utility" also provides a mouse access to Looking
Glass, a quick access to the extensions folders, and for Xorg users, a
way to reload the whole Shell with the mouse (no more need to do alt+f2).

I will not propose this extension on the official gnome extensions
website since the almost equivalent nls1729's "Gnome Shell Extension 
Reloader" is already on it.
